## Description

API Keys should only be used for services in cases where other authentication methods are unavailable. Unused keys with their permissions in tact may still exist within a project. Keys are insecure because they can be viewed publicly, such as from within a browser, or they can be accessed on a device where the key resides. It is recommended to use standard authentication flow instead.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Go to `APIs & Services\Credentials` using
2. In the section `API Keys`, to delete API Keys: Click the `Delete Bin Icon` in front of every `API Key Name`.

### From CLI:

1. Run the following from within the project you wish to audit  **`gcloud services apikeys list --filter`**
2. **Pipe the results into ** `gcloud alpha services api-keys delete`

### Default Value:

By default, API keys are not created for a project.
